          <hr>
          <p style="margin-top: 4vw;">
            Part of Our Website uses “cookies” and similar technology. When the website is accessed, the Company or a specified third party might set a cookie in your computer, tablet, smartphone, or mobile phone (“Device”). <br><br>
            The Company uses cookies to make Our Websites more convenient when Our Websites are viewed. The cookies are not used to identify your personal or other information, to read information from your hard disk, to send computer viruses, or to identify your email address. In addition, cookies are used for statistical analysis of Our Websites usage conditions and advertising. Accepting the use of cookies is recommended when using Our Websites. <br><br>
            This cookie policy will be suitably revised as necessary. Revisions to this cookie policy become effective when the latest version of the cookie policy is posted on Our Websites by the Company. <br><br>
            Please make inquiries regarding this cookie policy using the given contact information. <br>

            <p>
              A web beacon is a small image file (called “clear GIF,” etc.) that is embedded in the website and it can identify if you have visited that website and if so, how many times. <br><br>

Generally, the electronic images that are seen as part of the website, including ad banners, can function as web beacons. Web beacons are generally very small, and are a file like a 1×1 pixel banner. <br> <br>

The web beacons used by the Company do not collect personal information, statistically analyze it, view it, or share it but just create anonymous statistics about the website use. The web beacon system the Company uses to collect this information is a system called Google Analytics that is provided by Google, Inc. (www.google.com/analytics). Web beacons have the same effect as cookies, so references in this policy that refer to cookies also refer to web beacons. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p style="color: black ;font-weight: 300; font-size: 2vw; margin-top: 5vw; margin-bottom: 3vw;">Use and purpose of the cookies of the Company and third parties</p>
            <p>

                  This cookie is used to obtain information for improving the website by analyzing website usage and counting the number of visitors.For example, it collects information about website use, such as the browser or OS you use, the domain names of websites you have visited in the past, average visit time, and viewed pages.
